/*
 * This class defines a general probability mass functions,
 * which mean the probability distribution is discrete in the domain.
 * 
 * In order to extend this class a probability mass function like class should indicate
 *     1/ how to calculate the mass at each point -- mass(int x)
 *        (return NaN if given integer is out of domain)
 *     2/ how to get cumulative probability between two points(inclusive) 
 *        -- getCumulativeProbability(int lowerBound, int upperBound)
 *        (return NaN if given bounds are out of domain)
 *        (throw IllegalArgumentException if lowerBound is greater than upperBound)
 *     3/ how to get the variance of this probability mass function -- variance()
 *     4/ how to get the mean of this probability mass function -- mean()
